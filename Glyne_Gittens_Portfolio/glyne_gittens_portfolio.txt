My portfolio can be found on my Github https://github.com/ArtBears/portfolio
Or you can see my website that I built at glynegittens.com

The Applio Website Will not allow me to upload a folder filled with files. 
As a programmer, a lot of my source code is found in different folders and
will not work with Applioâ€™s current architecture.
